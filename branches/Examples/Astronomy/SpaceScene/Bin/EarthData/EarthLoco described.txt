Format of location file entry (where date is in dd/mm/yyyy) : (24/Jan/1972)
(1972-01-24 that's the _only_ sensible way of sorting dates... it all becomes a Delphi Datefield number... 0 to xxxxx now)
The date is displayed per System settings it seems...

longitude(E-W), latitude(N-S), type, Glow, type name,name,nickname,city,state,country,GLS date,DOB date,photo path+name,e-mail,url link,Demo Name,Description

[20 characters is about all that displays, 
depending on the number of i's and ls' :), no set physical limit?]

* = REQUIRED data 

*longitude(E-W) 
*latitude(N-S)
*type (GLS interest.. Default to 0: Undecided Type)

date (Date Of Birth: DOB)
photo path+name (path+name are actually only local...)
e-mail (auto link)

Description (of actual GLS Project...Interest. Length: [5x256 char].. or maybe a 2 meg string.. or maybe 25 words or less) How long can a Readln be?
... no more data.. no more room on form
