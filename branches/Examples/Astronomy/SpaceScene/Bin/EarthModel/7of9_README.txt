7of9_README.txt			15:44 03DEC99

This model is based on "7of9", from Star Trek: Voyager. Though I intend to release several female 
models for Half-Life, "7" has sat around waiting for the others. I just feel it's her time. "7" is specifically designed to be 'skinner friendly' (SkF). What I mean is anyone who wants to repaint the skin should be able to look at it, and tell exactly what's what. Thus, 'SkF'. If you do a nice repaint please feel free to send it to me at:

mann_slaughter@usa.net

I think a nice skin of Marvel Comics' "Black Widow" would kick ass!

This model has NO team color capability. If the colors in the preview pic change, don't worry. They WON'T change in-game.
You are more than welcome to distribute this model, so long as you don't CHARGE A FEE FOR IT!
Also, be sure to give Mann Slaughter credit for the original.
Have Fun!
